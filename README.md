## HOW CLIENT CONNECTS WITH SERVER? 

User and Application Interface: The user interacts with the application through our user interface built with React. The user inputs are sent from the UI to the backend server using REST API requests 

Frontend: The front-end is responsible for presenting information to the user and collecting user input. It then communicates with the server via GET requests and receives the data that it then displays to the user. The Front-End performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations itself and the server is calling the functions inside the movieAPI handler and the GeminiApi handler responses 

Backend Server: The server splits into different handlers for their own specific functions; movieAPIHandler for the movie-related requests and geminiAPIHandler for requests handled by the Gemini API

Database: MongoDB is then used as the database solution, storing historical and operation data that the server queries or modifies. This database is integral for persisting data that is accessed and manipulated by the API Handlers.  

All in all, the user sends a request from the front end which is received by the server. The server processes the request, fetching or storing data in MongoDB as necessary. The requested data or result of the operation is then sent back to the front end as a REST response, which updates the UI accordingly.
